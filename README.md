# STM32F303-
Interfacing transducers with the STM32F3 micro by operating the Kiel uVision IDE.

Project includes:

* Digital outputs via GPIO interfacing – enabling a GPIO port to control the state of 8 LEDs
* Analogue inputs – enabling analogue voltages to be input to the microcontroller
* Initialising and utilising the onboard ADC and DAC
* Scaling – introduction of electronic circuits to enable full use of digital range
* Initialising onboard timer to generate interrupt (ISR)
* Timer-based interrupts – use the on-board timers to control the sample rate
