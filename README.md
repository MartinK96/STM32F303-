# STM32F303-
Interfacing transducers with the STM32F3 micro by operating the Kiel uVision IDE.

Project includes:

* Digital outputs via GPIO interfacing – enabling a GPIO port to control the state of 8 LEDs
* Analogue inputs – enabling analogue voltages to be input to the microcontroller
* Initialising and utilising the onboard ADC and DAC
* Scaling – introduction of electronic circuits to enable full use of digital range

• Designing an interface to a required level of resolution and sample rate
• Designing fundamental analogue circuitry for conditioning signals
