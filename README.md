# STM32F303-
Interfacing transducers with the STM32F3 micro by operating the Kiel uVision IDE.

Project includes:

  Writing appropriate code to configure GPIO ports to output binary signals
  Writing appropriate code to implement timer-based interrupts
  Writing values to change LED states
  Initialising and utilising the onboard ADC and DAC
  PSC and ARR calculations for interrupt timing
  Initialising onboard timer to generate interrupt (ISR)
  ISR created to write analogue voltages to input
  Adjusting sampling rate of the ADC via interrupt timing
